# Project aim
We plan to use generative modelling algorithms in Machine Learning, to synthesize music. The goal is to understand how generative modelling techniques can be used to create new content. Is background information required to effectively generate content (by adding parameters that are only specific to this problem, like music synthesis is different from image synthesis), or simply feeding the data to neural network by tuning the hyperparameters enables the network to learn the data effectively?
